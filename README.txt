======

Run this project with the Makefile

> make
> make demo
> make demo1
> make demo2
> make demo3
> make demo4
> make demo5

Make step   : Binaries will be created.
Make Demo's : Will run few test cases with the results printed on screen.

> make clean

This will clear the binaries and the temporary linker files.

P.S : I have attached all the input test case files mapped to the case numbers. All input files should be present in the same location where the code is run.
